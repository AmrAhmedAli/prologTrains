%generate_tasks iterates over the list of tuples.
%and checks the SS and ES (StartingStation, EndingStation).
%and dependingly it creates a task with (StartingTime,Duration,EndingTime,1,IDOfTrain) 
%and then assigns this task to a connection depends on the SS and ES.

%As this list of tuples is orderd.
%by orderd i mean that that train will pass from its starting station first.
%and the starting station will be the first element in this list of tuples.
%and so on to the end of the route.
%Therefore when passing the same predicate to the TrainTail. 
%we will set the starting time of the tail. to the ending time of the previous task.

%The ending time of the train "END" will always remain the same. waiting for the last element
%in the list of tuples.

%and works normally if two trains are in different directions.
%by works normally, i mean that the 2nd train can start right after the 1st one finishes.
